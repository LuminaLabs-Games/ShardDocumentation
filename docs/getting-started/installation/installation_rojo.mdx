# Installation

Install shard using Visual Studio Code or GitHub Desktop.

With [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you have two ways of installing Shard. With our visual studio code extension, or by cloning the repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and/or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

We recommend using the **[Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WilWilson.shard-framework)** for a smoother experience, especially if you're new to Shard.
