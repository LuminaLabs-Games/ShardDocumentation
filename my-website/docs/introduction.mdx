# Introduction

**Shard** is a customizable, single-file, controller-service oriented, and object-oriented framework built for Roblox developers. It comes with [ProfileStore](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileStore/) and [Replica](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/Replica/) integrated by default, enabling seamless data persistence and real-time replication.

Using the Shard plugin, you can spin up a fully functional server-client architecture in seconds, with built-in data and replication systems that scale easily.

Shard is built with simplicity and flexibility in mind, it reduces boilerplate and improves development speed, letting you focus on creating polished gameplay experiences without getting bogged down by infrastructure code.
