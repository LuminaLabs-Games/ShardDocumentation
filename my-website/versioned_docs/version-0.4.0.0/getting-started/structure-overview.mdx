# Structure Overview

This page serves as a high-level summary of how the Shard framework is structured. If you're new to Shard, this is a great place to get familiar with its core components and how they fit together.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

### 🧩 [Controllers](../shard-api/controllers.mdx)

Controllers are **client-side modules** responsible for UI, input handling, camera logic, and more.

- Auto-loaded from the `src/client/Controllers` file/folder.
- Can optionally define lifecycle methods:
  - `initialize()`: Prepare state, set up connections.
  - `start()`: Begin logic after all modules are initialized.
- Registered in `GetModule` automatically.

> Example use: Front end setup, UI transitions, camera effects, hotkey input listeners.

---

### 🛠️ [Services](../shard-api/services.mdx)

Services are **server-side modules** that manage backend logic such as data, game rounds, NPCs, and more.

- Auto-loaded from the `src/server/Services` file/folder.
- Same lifecycle methods: `initialize()` and `start()`.
- Can call and communicate with other services via `GetModule` or `Dispatcher`.

> Example use: Plot manager, Matchmaking, inventory management, round control.

### 🧠 [Data (Player Data System)](../shard-api/data.mdx)

Shard comes bundled with a full player data system powered by:

- [ProfileStore](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileStore/): Handles persistent player sessions
- [Replica](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/Replica/): Replicates player data live to clients

Each player's data is wrapped in a `PlayerProfile` object, offering:

- `:Get()`, `:Set()`, `:Increment()`, `:Decrement()`
- Easy Message handlers set up for global gifting or commands

```lua
local profile = Data:GetProfileAsync(player)
if not profile then return end

profile:Increment("Coins", 25)
```

## 📦 Core Modules

### 📡 [SimpleNet](../shard-api/simplenet.mdx)

SimpleNet is Shard's custom networking layer.

It wraps and simplifies:

* RemoteEvents
* RemoteFunctions
* BindableEvents
* BindableFunctions

Provides utility methods like:

* `:FireAll()`
* `:FireAllExcept(player)`
* `:FireFilter((player) -> boolean)`
* `:FireDelayed(player, delayTime, ...)`

> Example:

```lua
local MyEvent = SimpleNet:remoteEvent("OpenShop")

MyEvent:Connect(function(player)
    print(player.Name .. " opened the shop")
end)
```
or

```lua
SimpleNet:remoteEvent("OpenShop", function(player)
	print(player.Name .. " opened the shop")
end)
```

---

### 📬 [Dispatcher](../shard-api/dispatcher.mdx)

Dispatcher is Shard's internal pub/sub event system.

* Works both globally and per-instance
* Supports:

  * `Subscribe()`
  * `SubscribeOnce()`
  * `Publish()`
  * `PublishDeferred()`
  * `Unsubscribe()`
  * Includes alias's and other methods

Useful for:

* Controller-to-controller or service-to-service messaging
* Decoupled event handling

```lua
Dispatcher:Subscribe("PrintMessage", function(messageToPrint)
    print("Message:", messageToPrint)
end)
```
From another module:
```lua
Dispatcher:Publish("PrintMessage", "Hello, world!")
-- Output: Message: Hello, world!
```


---

### 🔎 [GetModule](../shard-api/GetModule.mdx)

GetModule acts as a **central registry** of loaded modules.

* You can fetch any initialized controller/service/module by name.
* If the module isn't found internally, it will fall back to searching `ReplicatedStorage` or `ServerStorage`.
* This is useful if you decide to use OOP services or controllers, as it will grab the constructed object. However, this can also work for non-OOP modules.

> Example:

```lua
local RoundService = GetModule("RoundService")
RoundService:StartRound()
```
