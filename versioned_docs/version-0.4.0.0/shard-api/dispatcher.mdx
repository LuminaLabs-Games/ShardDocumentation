# 📢 Dispatcher

**Dispatcher** is Shard's built-in lightweight publish/subscribe system used for decoupled communication between services, controllers, or modules. It helps reduce tight coupling and boilerplate RemoteEvent usage when events are scoped to the same environment (client ↔ client or server ↔ server).

It supports both singleton-based and instance-based event routing.

---

## 🧩 Common Use Cases

- Controller-to-controller UI communication (e.g. `OpenUI`, `CloseUI`)
- Service-to-service event handling (e.g. `PlayerJoined`, `PlayerLeft`)
- Service-to-service coordination without circular dependencies
- Broadcasting events to multiple subscribers
- Scoped or dynamic dispatching via local `Dispatcher.new()`

---

## 🧪 Basic Usage

```lua
local Dispatcher = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Dispatcher)

-- Subscribe to an event
Dispatcher:Subscribe("OpenShop", function()
    print("Shop was opened!")
end)

-- Fire the event
Dispatcher:Publish("OpenShop")
````

## 🧠 API Reference

| Method                                           | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Subscribe(event, callback, callbackName?)`      | Connect to an event. Optional `callbackName` allows named unsubscription. |
| `Listen(...)` / `listen(...)` / `subscribe(...)` | Aliases for `Subscribe`                                                   |
| `SubscribeOnce(event, callback, callbackName?)`  | One-time event subscription                                               |
| `Unsubscribe(event, callbackName?)`              | Remove a specific named callback, or all for that event                   |
| `Publish(event, ...)`                            | Fire all callbacks for an event and yield on results                      |
| `PublishDeferred(event, ...)`                    | Same as `Publish`, but deferred to the next frame                         |
| `PublishNoYield(event, ...)`                     | Fires all callbacks in parallel with `task.spawn`                         |

---

## 🧪 Named Callback Example

```lua
Dispatcher:Subscribe("Shop", function(toggle)
    print("Shop was toggled:", toggle)
end, "ShopToggle")

Dispatcher:Subscribe("Shop", function()
    print("Apply the discount!")
end, "ShopDiscount")

-- Later when the discount should no longer be applied:
Dispatcher:Unsubscribe("Shop", "ShopDiscount")
```
> Named callbacks are useful when you want to manage multiple listeners separately to a single event, unsubscribe one without affecting the rest.

---

## 🔄 One-Time Listener

```lua
Dispatcher:SubscribeOnce("PlayCutscene", function()
    print("This only runs once!")
end)
```

---

## 🚦 Instance-Based Dispatcher

You can create your own scoped Dispatcher instances for isolated systems:

```lua
local Dispatcher = require(ReplicatedStorage.Packages.Dispatcher)

local myDispatcher = Dispatcher.new()

myDispatcher:Subscribe("Ping", function(msg)
    print("Ping received:", msg)
end)

myDispatcher:Publish("Ping", "Hello World")
```

> Internally, Dispatcher uses a `DispatcherSingleton` for global events. When using `.new()`, you get a fresh isolated `_events` table.

---

## 🔁 Returning Multiple Values

The `Dispatcher:Publish()` method supports returning values from **all subscribers**, including multiple values per callback. This allows you to gather results from multiple systems in a clean and consistent way.

---

### 🧪 Example: System Readiness Check

```lua
Dispatcher:Subscribe("CheckSystemsReady", function()
    return "✅ Inventory Ready"
end, "InventorySystem")

Dispatcher:Subscribe("CheckSystemsReady", function()
    return "✅ Matchmaking Ready"
end, "MatchmakingSystem")

Dispatcher:Subscribe("CheckSystemsReady", function()
    return "✅ DataStore Ready"
end, "DataSystem")

local ready1, ready2, ready3 = Dispatcher:Publish("CheckSystemsReady")

print("System Statuses:")
print(ready1) --> ✅ Inventory Ready
print(ready2) --> ✅ Matchmaking Ready
print(ready3) --> ✅ DataStore Ready
```

---

### 📦 Example: Returning Tuples

You can also return multiple values per subscriber. These values will be flattened into a single return list:

```lua
Dispatcher:Subscribe("GetStats", function()
    return 5, "Bronze"
end)

Dispatcher:Subscribe("GetStats", function()
    return 12, "Gold"
end)

local score1, rank1, score2, rank2 = Dispatcher:Publish("GetStats")

print(score1, rank1) --> 5 Bronze
print(score2, rank2) --> 12 Gold
```

---

:::warning Warning - Best Practices

* Avoid returning mixed or unpredictable shapes, if structure matters, wrap values in tables:
  ```lua
  return { score = 5, rank = "Bronze" }
  ```
* Consider limiting return expectations to **diagnostics, hooks, or aggregates**, not for business-critical logic.
